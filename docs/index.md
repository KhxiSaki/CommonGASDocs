What is Gameplay Ability System?

``
The Gameplay Ability System is a highly flexible framework for building the types of abilities and attributes that you might find in an RPG or MOBA title. You can build actions or passive abilities for the characters in your games to use, and status effects that can build up or wear down various attributes as a result of these actions, additionally you can implement "cooldown" timers or resource costs to regulate the usage of these actions, change the level of the ability and its effects at each level, activate particle, sound effects, and more. The Gameplay Ability System can help you to design, implement, and efficiently network in-game abilities from as simple as jumping to as complex as your favorite character's ability set in any modern RPG or MOBA title.
